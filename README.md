# Final Task: The Movie Web Page

**Project Goal:** Your task is to create a functional and visually accurate clone of the "Popular Movies" page from The Movie Database (TMDB) website. This assignment is designed to test your ability to work with a real-world API and build a responsive user interface.


**Project Requirements**

1. **UI Duplication:**
    - Recreate the core layout and styling of the https://www.themoviedb.org/movie page.
    - Focus on the main content area: The "Popular Movies" section, the sorting options, and the movie cards.
    - The header and footer are placeholders for now. You do not need to implement any complex navigation, login or search functionality in the header.
2. **API Integration:**
    - All movie data must be fetched from the official TMDB API.
    - Use the "Get Popular" endpoint: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list.
3. **Functionality:**
    - Initial Load: The page should load with the first page of popular movies displayed.
    - Sorting: Implement the sorting functionality exactly as it appears on the original TMDB page (e.g., "Popularity Descending," "Release Date Descending"). This requires you to correctly pass the sort_by parameter to the API.
    - Filtering: The filters should work as on the page excluding “Where to Watch”, "Certifications" and "Show Me" sections
    - Load More: Implement a "Load More" button at the bottom of the movie list. When clicked, it must fetch 20 movies on every click.

**Grading Rubric** - Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Presentation and Visual Appearance - 50% 
    - UI Fidelity: 15%
    - The design and layout of the movie cards, sorting controls, and overall page structure closely match the original TMDB page.
    - Responsive Design: 15% The layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) without horizontal scrolling or broken elements.
    - User Experience (UX): 10% The sorting and "Load More" functionality is intuitive and working as expected.
    - Consistency: 10% Consistent use of fonts, colors, spacing, and icons. Movie posters and rating circles are displayed correctly.

2. Clear and Structured Code - 50% 
    - Code Structure & Organization: 15% The codebase is well-organized with separated folders handling all the logic.
    - Clarity & Readability: 20% Variable and function names are descriptive and follow conventions. Code is formatted consistently, and comments explain complex logic.
    - API Integration Logic: 15% API calls are handled correctly (e.g., using async/await or Promises). Error states are handled gracefully (e.g., what happens if the API call fails).

**Submission & Late Policy**
    - Late Policy: Any submissions made after the deadline will result in a 50% reduction in your final grade. Please communicate any extenuating circumstances well in advance of the deadline.

**🚨 Important**
- Use CSS variables
- Use BEM approach for CSS, JS and HTML

**Extra:** Use github pages(https://pages.github.com/) to make a link to your web page.
